                <h4>About the Movie</h4>
                <p>Spiderman: Across the Spider-Verse is the sequel to Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse, which
                    introduced Miles Morales, the second spiderman to exist in his dimension. Shortly after gaining his
                    powers, a rift in the multiverse opens up, and Miles meets several other "spider-people" from other
                    dimensions. The sequel picks up where the first movie left off, with all the spider-people back in
                    their original dimension and Miles is missing his other-dimensional friends. He is struggling to fit
                    in at school and is having trouble balancing his life as a superhero with his life as a student.
                    Miles is one day surprised to see Gwen appearing through a portal in his room. He is even more
                    surprised to hear that she has joined an "elite force" of spider-people who can travel between
                    dimensions without the risk of glitching thanks to their watches. Miles is disappointed when Gwen
                    refuses to let him go with her on her interdimensional missions and he soon discovers that there is
                    a much darker side to the "elite force" than Gwen let on.

                <h4>Animation</h4>
                <p>
                    The Spider-Verse film franchise has been trail-blazing new animation techniques from the get-go.
                    These movies are another stellar example of combining 3D and 2D elements to make visually incredible
                    films. The first movie incporated so many revolutionary techniques, such as using Ben-Day dots
                    throughout most of the artwork to give it the same aesthetic as a comic book. Like Puss in Boots:
                    The Last Wish, these films incorporate different frame rates to emphasize certain elements. In the
                    first film while Miles is still getting used to his new powers, he is animated on twos while Peter
                    B. Parker, who has already perfected his craft, is animated on ones. This makes Miles' movements
                    look less refined and smooth. In Across the Spider-Verse, the animators took this technique to the
                    next level and decided to animate another character, Hobie, on threes. Rather than making his
                    movements look less practiced like in the first movie, Hobie's clearly 'zine and graffiti-inspired
                    design resulted in his movements looking far more 2D than the other characters and evoked a very
                    paper-like texture.
                </p>
                <h4>Social Implications</h4>
                <p>
                    There are several socially impactful elements to this film. The first film was obviously impactful
                    in its featuring a black-latino superhero. One of the most notable elements of the second film is a
                    background element that we see in Gwen's bedroom, a trans pride flag that reads "Protect Trans
                    Kids." Consequently, many fans believe that Gwen herself is trans and she has become something of a
                    trans icon. This is further emphasized by the colour palette of her super suit very closely matching
                    the trans flag. The film features many other diverse characters in terms of race, disability,
                    sexuality, and gender. It is a wonderful example of representation in animation and has already
                    resonated with so many fans.
