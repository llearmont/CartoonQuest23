                <h4>About the Show</h4>
                <p>The Owl House is a Disney Channel animated show about a young girl named Luz who feels like a misfit
                    at home, but stumbles upon another dimension where she meets a witch named Eda the Owl Lady and an
                    adorable demon named King who both also feel like misfits. Since Luz is supposed to be at summer
                    camp anyway, she decides to stay and learn how to be a witch from Eda.
                </p>
                <h4>Animation</h4>
                <p>
                    At face value, the animation in this show is very similar to many other Disney Cartoon shows.
                    However, the animation of the different characters magic use and expecially the magical fight scenes
                    make this show really stand out. The lighting and the choreography of these scenes are incredible,
                    especially those in the show's finale.
                </p>
                <h4>Social Implications</h4>
                <p>
                    The Owl House pushed the boundaries of representation in Disney Cartoons by including several
                    LGBTQIA+ characters, but particularly the main character. Luz identifies as bisexual and dates a
                    girl at her school, Amity. Additionally, Eda's main love interest in the show, Raine, is non-binary.
                    This of course was very meaningful to many fans of the show. LGBTQIA+ fans loved seeing characters
                    who they could relate to in such a wonderfully wholesome and adventurous cartoon. However, the
                    Disney execs did not share their perspective. Without the creator, Dana Terrace's knowledge, the
                    executives met and decided to cancel the show under the guise of the show "not reaching its intended
                    age group." Though it cannot be proven that this was in fact the homophobia of Disney corporate
                    rearing its ugly head, it is awfully convenient that this news of cancellation came shortly after
                    the production of an episode where Luz and Amity became an official couple.
