                <h4>About the Movie</h4>
                <p>Elemental is a movie produced by Pixar animation studio and is the studio's first attempt at a true
                    rom-com since Wall-E. The movie depicts a world where there are different races of people based on
                    the elements
                    of fire, water, earth and air all living in Element City. Water people make up the majority and the
                    city has been very much designed for them and as a result, is not very safe for fire people. The
                    movie follows a fire family who immigrate to Element City in the hopes of building a better life for
                    their daughter, but this proves to be more difficult than they had anticipated. The fire community
                    is very segregated from the rest of Element City and they are at several disadvantages due to how
                    risky being close to water can be. Ember feels she has a very clear picture of how things work here
                    and how elements simply cannot mix until she meets Wade, a water guy.
                </p>
                <h4>Animation</h4>
                <p> Pixar animation nevers fails to impress and Elemental is no exception. The animators put so much
                    effort into the physics and movement of the characters. The fire people are constantly moving and
                    their flames are constantly burning and flickering depending on their surroundings. The water people
                    are constantly dripping and can easily reshape themselves, while the water that their bodies are
                    composed up is constantly rippling. The different elements have the opacities that you would expect
                    encountering them in the real world, which creates some really complex and beautiful lighting
                    scenarios.
                </p>
                <h4>Social Implications</h4>
                <p>
                    Elemental is a beautiful and simple way to depict a interracial relationship and all the struggles
                    that come with it. Ember has been with her family her whole life and has never really had much
                    chance to consider what her life might be like outside of her parents' "bubble." She feels pressured
                    into taking over her father's shop, but she struggles with interacting with customers. When Wade
                    first splashes into her life, he is not a welcome presence. He is a city inspector who feels he is
                    obligated to report all of Ember's father's shop's safety violations. He sends in his report moments
                    before hearing Ember's story and how much this shop means to her family. He immediately feels
                    terrible and the two team up to reverse the tickets and make sure the shop is safe. Through their
                    time together, Ember sees how sweet and emotionally intelligent Wade is and she begins to fall for
                    him. She is conflicted because she knows her parents would not approve of her dating a water guy,
                    but Wade's genuine empathy is irresistible. He's the mature and loving presence she really needs to
                    gain the courage to chase her dreams. It not only speaks to the marginalized and those in
                    interracial relationships but it depicts a beautiful picture of how to grow and mature in one's
                    mental health.
