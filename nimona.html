                <h4>About the Movie</h4>
                <p>Nimona is a Netflix Original movie based on a graphic novel. In a futuristic/medieval setting, the
                    first commoner to ever train to become a knight, Ballister is framed for the murder of the Queen and
                    as a result, he gets disarmed - literally - by his boyfriend. Our titular character, Nimona, sees a
                    news report about him and decides that he is the perfect villainous boss for her. She follows him
                    around, trying to convince him to lean into his new reputation while Ballister tries to clear his
                    name.
                </p>
                <h4>Animation</h4>
                <p>
                    Like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Nimona is another film that seemlessly blends 3D animation with
                    2D stylization. It utilizes geometric symbolism, dramatic lighting, and dynamic character movement.
                    It is another beautiful film that is definitely worth multiple watches.
                </p>
                <h4>Social Implications</h4>
                <p>Firstly, you likely noticed I mentioned that our protagonist, Ballister, is gay and his relationship
                    with his boyfriend is a wonderful instance of representation. Not only that, but it is very much
                    normalized by the movie and is not in the spotlight for long. The biggest social advancement of this
                    movie is Nimona herself.
                    Nimona, as a shapeshifter who frequently takes forms of different species and different genders, has
                    quickly become a trans and gender-fluid icon. Fans are drawn to her, both because of her chaotic
                    personality and because of her tragic backstory. Many gender-queer fans can relate to her feelings
                    of internalizing what is said about her by the people she had thought were her friends and her
                    resulting feelings of worthlessness. Her emotional journey can ellicit tears from even the most
                    stoic viewer.
