                <h4>About the Movie</h4>
                <p>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was released in December 2022 and invites viewers on a high-stakes
                    adventure to find the titular "Last Wish." As Puss discovers that he is down to the last life of his
                    original nine, he is forced to confront his mortality.
                </p>
                <h4>Animation</h4>
                <p>
                    The animation in this film was and is ground-breaking, as it expertly blends 3D animation with 2D
                    textures. Though the majority of the film is 3D, every surface in the movie looks like watercolor
                    paint. Viewers may notice that many highlights and details look like brushstrokes. Additionally, it
                    alters the status quo of frame rate in animation. During many of the fight scenes, the animators
                    chose to animate on twos. This decreased amount of frames effectively makes the audience feel as if
                    the characters are moving even faster.
                </p>
                <h4>Social Implications</h4>
                <p>
                    For obvious reasons, animation nerds lost their minds over the art style in this movie. It's so
                    visually incredible that viewers can't help but love it. But more than that, this movie depicts
                    mental health struggles, specifically anxiety and panic attacks in a very realistic and relatable
                    way. It shows that mental health is something that affects everyone, but also how rapidly one's own
                    mental health can change. Puss goes from "Fearless" and "Invincible" to feeling terrified and
                    insignificant in a manner of hours in the timeline of the story. It's a beautiful story of growth
                    and acceptance of one's own struggles.
